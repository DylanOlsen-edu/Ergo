Ergo: Framework for the Future
The origin story of the founders {(Chepurnoy, Alex),(Meshkov, Dimitry)} begins in 2015. The two of them were working together on a project, Scorex, a modular blockchain engine framework created to produce systems and test them as fast as possible, along with fast prototyping and experimentation.(insert reference mark) This project caught the attention of Cardano and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. This is when Alex became one of the first employees at IOHK, an engineering and research company that builds blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Alex became the Director of ScoreX projects, managing developers and writing code out of passion. Dimitry followed soon after and deployed R&D for IOHK, focused on a framework for blockchain prototyping. The two of them began the developing what would become, Ergo, in 2017. They spent two years working through problems within the Bitcoin accounting model, known as the unspent transaction model (UTXO). They took the script and make it more expressive.
Ergo launched July 1st, 2019.
Alex Chepurnoy is the Co-Founder and Core Developer of the Ergo Platform. Alex has written over twenty academic papers and has more than fifteen years of experience in Software Development. He was also a Core Developer for NXT and co-founded smartcontract.com, now known as Chainlink. 
Dimitry Meshkov is a Core Developer on Ergo. Dimitry has a PhD in Physics and over ten years experience in software development. He has written several peer-reviewed papers on cryptocurrency. 
Ergo is dedicated to the original verison of Bitcoin Proof-of-Work. New protocols are trying to acheive high throughput, complicated smart contracts, etc. while sacrificing decentralization. Ergo maintains a rigourous research and scientific approach to the issues they are attempting the solve. "The current state of the market is a little sad. We need to get back to the roots of the crypto revolution, decentralized tools that are private and secure, drive real-world adoption of these systems. The ideal is to create tools that help people create value" (Ergo Manifesto). 
In Decemember of 2019, Ergo had more than 500 million in Ethereum locked as collateral in contracts. They do not seek investments for Ergo itself, rather they seek investments for projects or applications launched on Ergo.
The finacial problem that Ergo is trying to solve can be quoted from Ergo's offcial website ergoplatform.org "Ergo is a next-generation Proof-of-work platform that enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by a safe, rich scripted language. Built with flexible and powerful zero-knowledge proof sigma-protocols." Ergo provides a decentralized ecosystem, with an outstanding programming foundation, that is open source and permissionless. Trust and adoption of this technology could lead to unbanking yourself from most third-party intermediaries.  
"Ergo is committed to being a tool for regular people, thier interests shall not be infringed upon in favor of big parties." (Ergo Manifesto) Mining in Ergo requires much less energy than larger competitors like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ergo prioritizes thier miners, incentivizing them to continue to mine when hypothetically, could mine Bitcoin or Ethereum at a higher profitability rate. The founders are trying to attract everyday average joes from all around the globe to adopt the technology. 
Ergo is a Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency with a fair intial launch. Ergo was mined from zero via PoW with no intial coin offering. Miners have first dibs as miners are minting Ergo into thier wallets before it ever hits an exchange. Luckily, the founders developed a PoW algorithim called Autolykos that efficiently mines ERGO on lower quality GPUS. So much so, it is possibe to mine Ergo on a cellphone, and sent directly to a secure wallet if the node is setup correctly. In the mining market, Autolykos is the first ASIC-resistant and pool resistant consensus algorithim to be deployed. 
Remember that Silicon Valley show, the one about data compression? Ergo did just that for the blockchain, calling them NIPoPoWs (Non-Interactive Proof of Proof of Work). The application is to dramatically reduce the size of a blockchain. Ergo Platform released an article on NIPoPoWs on Ergo stating "Bitcoin's blockchain is over 300 GB. Due to its smart contracts, Ethereum's blockchain is almost a Terrabyte! Anyone wanting to run a node will need a sizeable harddrive and wait between 1 to 5 days for the node to sync. NiPoPoWs will allow super light clients to sync to the blockchain with less than 1MB of data. NIPoPoWs will enable limited technology, such as flip phones, to operate with limited data service, and achieve the same security level as running a full node. This has the potential to completely revolutionize the industry."
Ergo is in the FinTech domain of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.
Major innovations of the last 5-10 years in this domain has to be the success of Ethereum, the open-source and smart contract functional cryptocurrency. Due to the ability to create custom tokens on Ethereum, NFTs were born. Proof-of-Stake would be another innovation in the short term that has gained popularity. 
Major currencies in the space are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and an unstable stablecoin.
To date, developers have created some very useful applications built on top of Ergo. 
The most notable being a decentralized exchange (DEX) called ErgoDEX co-founded by Ilya Oskin. The DEX holds some useful tokens, I will breifly share a couple of them. SigUSD is a decentralized stablecoin backed by Ergo, overcollaterallized by 400% to 800% reserve ratio. A reserve-backed model is a superior model in preventing cascading liquidations during extreme volatility. In other words, when the price begins to fall and users are liquidating thier positions, the stablecoin will hold its peg to the dollar.
ErgoPad is a token launch platform for Ergo, giving the user an opportunity to get in on the ground foor with Ergo token Intial DEX Offerings. They help projects navigate ErgoScript to build safe apps for all.
ErgoLend is a P2P lending platform with easy to use tools to borrow and lend money on the Ergo Blockchain. The goal is to leverage blockchain technology to create a golbal lending platform. With lower borrowing costs, smaller loans become viable. This opens up a large, untapped market of borrowers. 
SkyHarbor.io is the most popular site for purchasing Ergo NFTs. Similar to OpenSea. 
Based on these developments, I would state thier buisness impact has been positive and developing well.
